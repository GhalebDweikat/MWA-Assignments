1. SetImmediate adds a function to the Check queue while SetTimeout adds it to the Timer queue. This proves helpful when the order
of execution is important for asynchronous events.
2. process.nextTick adds a function to the nextTick (priority) queue which has instant priority and will be executed on the next
Event Loop tick. On the other hand, setImmediate adds the function to the Check queue which may take many more Event Loop ticks to
get executed.
